As for Week 3 and Week 5, I got full marks.
However, for Week4, I made two mistakes:
    1. For variables.py, the truth table is wrong.  When "W = A and B", W should only be true when both X and Y are true
    2. For mystery_code.py,  my answer should be more accurate by including " within a specified range, which is between 1 and 6".
