I think that everything almost went well but I truly had some problems with typing speed and finding the correct codes. 
Moreover, sometimes when I encounter with some errors, I am unable to fix it. 
I find correcting these mistakes quite challenging.
I have questions about how to make further improvements on version control and editing.
