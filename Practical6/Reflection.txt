I think it is really so challenging for me. However, it is also very rewarding.
I enjoy the process of debugging and learning while coding. Initially, I struggled with debugging complex code and fine-tuning model parameters, but overcoming these obstacles deepened my understanding of algorithmic logic and problem-solving techniques.
Through this practical, I greatly improved my skills of plotting a chart and impelementing a model. This experience solidified my confidence in tackling technical challenges and underscored the importance of hands-on practice in mastering programming.
